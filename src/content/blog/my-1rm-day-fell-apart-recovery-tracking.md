Today was 1RM day.

I walked into the gym like always. The bar looks the same, the plates clang the same, and a calm voice lands in your head: *14 weeks of work end here.*

But the lifts didn’t feel explosive. They felt... like wet cement.

Not "bad warmup" type heavy. More like "your body is running on overdrive."

## The setup (how I got here)

This one wasn’t mysterious. It was classic lifter dominoes:

1. I looked in the mirror and saw my big gut.
2. Sleep got worse.
3. Training load and ego stayed the same.
4. And eventually the bill arrived.

The annoying part is how delayed it is. You don’t always feel it on day one. Sometimes you don’t even feel it on week one. You feel it later, when performance starts leaking out of the corners.

That’s the trap: recovery debt is sneaky. It doesn’t announce itself. It just quietly takes your reps.

## What it felt like on the platform

You know the feeling:

- Warmups are heavier than they should be.
- Rest times get longer, but nothing "clicks."
- Technique gets sloppy in ways you can’t coach away.
- You start bargaining. *Maybe I’ll take smaller jumps. Maybe I’ll just hit a strong single and call it.*

And then you realize: this isn’t a "try harder" problem. It’s a "you should’ve known earlier" problem.

## The problem with most tracking

Most of us track **food** or **training**, but not the relationship between them.

- You can be "on plan" with calories and still be under-recovering.
- You can be "training hard" and still be digging a hole that only shows up later.
- You can be motivated as hell and still show up on the wrong day to test strength.

If you’re cutting and your sleep drops, you can absolutely keep training... but you need to know when to push and when to pivot.

## What I’m adding to Macro Monk

This is exactly why I’m adding **recovery tracking** to Macro Monk.

Not a complicated "biohacking cockpit." Just a simple signal that answers:

**Is today a good day to push? Or should I adjust the plan so I don’t light the fuse?**

Under the hood, the core idea is **"Should I train today?" logic** built from a few inputs that actually matter for lifters:

- Sleep (enough, or not enough)
- Training load (how much you’ve been doing)
- Intensity (how hard it’s been)
- Optional: cardio minutes / extra stressors

Then Macro Monk will do the boring but important part: **trend it, score it, and give you a simple decision badge**.

- **Train:** good day to push the planned session.
- **Adjust:** train, but reduce volume and/or cap intensity.
- **Recover:** skip max testing; focus on technique, accessories, or rest.

The goal is not to make you soft. The goal is to keep you strong.

## The takeaway

If you’re cutting and your sleep starts slipping, don’t wait for your lifts to collapse to learn the lesson.

Strength doesn’t disappear in one day. It leaks slowly. Recovery debt is interest.

Macro Monk is getting recovery tracking because I want a tool that tells you **before** the 1RM day becomes a reality check.

If you want to try it, the app is here:

And if you want to follow the build, I’ll post updates here as I add the features and refine the signals.
