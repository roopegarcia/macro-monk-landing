We shipped a few important improvements to make Macro Monk easier to use day to day.

## New: Schedule + food database units for North American users

You can now use the schedule alongside nutrition tracking and log food using unit options that fit North American habits better.

This makes planning and logging more practical when your daily workflow is based on common US/Canada serving units.

## New: Simplified Today dashboard with user preferences

Today’s dashboard now adapts to how you use Macro Monk.

You can choose to:

- Track only nutrition
- Use the full view with nutrition, training, and recovery

This keeps your dashboard focused on what you actually want to track, without extra noise.

## Summary

Macro Monk now gives you better unit support for North American food logging and a cleaner Today dashboard that matches your tracking style.
