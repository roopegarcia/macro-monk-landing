You do not need a perfect week. You need a repeatable week.

## Set one calorie target and hold it

Do not re-calculate every day. Pick one target, run it for 7 days, and judge with trend data.

## Keep meal structure boring

Use 3 to 5 repeatable meals you can log fast. Complexity kills consistency.

## Keep training quality high

A cut should reduce body-fat, not remove all training intensity. Keep hard sets in the plan and protect sleep.

## Review once per week

Use running averages for body weight and compare week to week. Adjust only if the trend is not moving.
