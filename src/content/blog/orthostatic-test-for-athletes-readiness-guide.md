For athletes, the **Orthostatic Test** is a gold-standard tool for monitoring the balance between **training load and recovery**. It tracks how your autonomic nervous system (ANS) responds to the stress of gravity and movement.

## 1. Why athletes use it

It detects if your **parasympathetic** (rest and digest) and **sympathetic** (fight or flight) systems are in sync.

- **Identify overtraining:** A heart rate (HR) that stays significantly higher than your baseline while standing suggests you are not recovering.
- **Monitor readiness:** It tells you if you can handle a high-intensity session or if you should pivot to an active recovery day.
- **Track adaptation:** Over time, a lowering trend in standing HR can indicate improved cardiovascular fitness.

## 2. How to perform the test

To get usable data, consistency is everything. Perform the test **every morning** immediately after waking up and using the bathroom.

1. **Preparation:** Wear a heart rate chest strap (optical wrist sensors are often not precise enough for the millisecond timing required for Heart Rate Variability).
2. **Supine phase (2-3 mins):** Lie down flat and remain completely still. This establishes your resting baseline.
3. **The transition:** Stand up at a normal, steady pace. Do not rush, but do not linger.
4. **Standing phase (2-3 mins):** Stand perfectly still. Your heart rate will spike initially and then settle. This "settled" standing HR and the HRV associated with it are the key metrics.

## 3. Interpreting the data

Compare your results to your **personal baseline** (average of the last 28 days), not to others.

- **Normal result:** HR and HRV are within your typical range. You are ready for high-intensity training.
- **Abnormal - elevated standing HR:** If your standing HR is >10 bpm higher than your average, it often indicates **systemic fatigue, dehydration, or an impending illness**.
- **Abnormal - low HRV:** A drop in HRV (specifically RMSSD) suggests your body is stuck in a "stress" state and needs more recovery.

## 4. Common pitfalls

- **Inconsistency:** Testing at different times of day or after caffeine will ruin the data.
- **External stress:** Mental stress (work, exams) affects the test just as much as a 20 km run.
- **Overreacting to one day:** Only change your training plan if you see a trend or a massive outlier accompanied by poor subjective feelings (soreness, bad mood).

## Universal metrics and interpretation

In athletic performance, a universal (brand-agnostic) **Orthostatic Test** focuses on the objective data points of heart rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) to assess "readiness to train." Unlike a standard resting HR check, this test challenges the autonomic nervous system by forcing it to react to a change in posture.

### Key universal metrics

- **RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences):** The most critical HRV metric for athletes. It measures short-term fluctuations and directly reflects **parasympathetic (vagal) activity**, which is responsible for recovery.
- **SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals):** Reflects overall variability and the total "reserve" of your nervous system.
- **HR Rest vs. HR Stand:** The raw difference in beats per minute (bpm) between lying down and standing.

### Universal interpretation guide

To interpret your results without a specific app, first establish a **baseline** (your average over 7-14 days of consistent morning testing).

#### Readiness action table

| Result Scenario | Likely Physiological State | Training Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline RMSSD & Low HR | Well-recovered; autonomic balance | Green Light: Proceed with high intensity. |
| Significant Drop in RMSSD | Vagal withdrawal; high systemic stress | Yellow/Red Light: Pivot to active recovery or rest. |
| High HR Stand (>15-20 bpm spike) | Sympathetic over-activity; potential dehydration or illness | Yellow Light: Reduce volume; check hydration. |
| Extremely High RMSSD + Low HR | Potential "Parasympathetic Overtraining" (rare, feels sluggish) | Yellow Light: Low-intensity aerobic work to re-awaken the system. |

## Universal Rusko test protocol

A widely recognized manual method for athletes is the **Rusko Orthostatic Test**:

1. **Lying (5 min):** Note the average HR during the last 2 minutes.
2. **Standing (2-3 min):** Stand up steadily.
3. **Data points:** Record HR at **15 seconds** (peak), **90 seconds**, and **120 seconds**.
4. **Analysis:** A fit heart should show a rapid initial spike followed by quick settling. A standing HR that remains significantly elevated (for example >20 bpm over lying) after 2 minutes is a classic sign of fatigue.

## Common baseline values for athletes

While individual baselines vary, research on elite athletes shows typical ranges:

- **RMSSD (resting):** 70-100+ ms (compared to 30-50 ms for sedentary individuals).
- **SDNN:** 150-220+ ms.
- **HR difference:** A settled standing HR that is **10-15 bpm** higher than supine is generally considered normal for a recovered athlete.
