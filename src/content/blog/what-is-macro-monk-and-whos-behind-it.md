Most fitness apps either drown you in data or treat you like a beginner.

Macro Monk is different: practical, fast, and built around one question every morning:

**What should I do today to keep progressing without burning out?**

## What makes Macro Monk different

### Morning decision engine

The app gives a daily training recommendation using recovery, yesterday's load, and trend signals.

### Recovery-first flow

No fake "go hard" hype before check-in. Log recovery first, then get a recommendation you can trust.

### Orthostatic test support (optional)

For serious lifters and coaches: supine + standing HR tracking with clear green/yellow/red guidance. If orthostatic is red two days in a row, the app pushes recovery or rest.

### Phase check-in with coach logic

Cut, bulk, and maintenance tracking that turns trends into actionable guidance.

### Macros without overcomplication

Set daily targets manually, or use the phase calculator and apply results in one click.

### Fast food logging that actually works

Favorites, default food database, personal foods, and quick filters built for real daily use.

### Clean UX

Lightweight, fast, no noise. Just the signals and tools that matter.

## Who’s behind Macro Monk (and why it exists)

I’m a busy dad, husband, homeowner, guitarist, coach, and a full-time developer. In other words: I have every normal adult excuse to quit training.

But I love lifting too much to let it fade out.

The truth is that training is rarely “easy” once life is full. Work gets heavy, sleep gets messy, stress piles up, and recovery doesn’t bounce back like it did at 20. If you train hard and try to stay lean, it’s ridiculously easy to drift into the same loop: push too much, cut too aggressively, sleep gets worse, performance drops, motivation follows.

Macro Monk came to life because I wanted a simple system that helps me keep training for decades, not just for a good 12-week block.

It’s built around the gym edition of the holy trinity: **training, nutrition, and recovery**. When those three are in balance, progress is boring and predictable (the best kind). When they’re not, you usually don’t notice until it’s too late.

I’ve made plenty of mistakes. I’ve overdone cuts, ignored sleep, and learned the hard way that “discipline” doesn’t replace recovery. Macro Monk is my attempt to package those lessons into a tool that helps other lifters stay consistent, succeed, and enjoy the process while getting older.

If you’re trying to build strength and a good life at the same time, you’re exactly who I built this for.

Macro Monk is a one-man project. I've failed more times than I can count, rebuilt this thing repeatedly, and kept going because the mission is simple:

**Help people stay consistent and keep lifting for life.**

If that resonates with you, try Macro Monk and tell me what would make it even better.
