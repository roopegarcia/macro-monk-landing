Scale weight is noisy. Water, digestion, sodium, and sleep can move the number fast.

## Look at averages, not single points

A 7-day running average tells you if the trend is moving in the expected direction.

## Weekly change gives context

A single low weigh-in can make progress look better than it is. Weekly comparisons are harder to fool.

## Make smaller adjustments

When trend data is stable, reduce calories or increase activity in small steps instead of aggressive swings.

## Focus on behavior quality

Good trend data starts with consistent logging, consistent meal structure, and consistent training.
