Macro tracking is useful when it feels sustainable.

## Build your personal food list

Start with foods you eat every week. Save them once and stop searching giant databases for every meal.

## Use the same breakfast and lunch on busy days

Decision fatigue is real. Repeated meals reduce friction and improve adherence.

## Track what matters most

Hit calories and protein first. Carbs and fats still matter, but these two numbers drive most outcomes.

## Expect imperfect days

If one meal is off, continue logging the rest of the day. Partial data is better than zero data.
